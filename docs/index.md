## Summary

Pokémon Blaze Black and Pokémon Volt White are edits of the regular Pokémon Black and White versions which self-contain all 649 Pokémon, allowing a player a large amount of variety. In addition, BB/VW also have edited trainers, an increased difficulty level, improvements to many Pokémon and more. They are the spiritual successor of my two other hacks, Pokémon Fire Red Omega and Pokémon Spirit Gold. Blaze Black and Volt White were also - with one minor exception - the first of their kind to be made.

I should mention that with the exception of things normally different between Black and White such as Black City, White Forest, the legendary focus and the appearance of Opelucid City, the two games are identical.

## Specific Features

As aforementioned, the hack allows you to catch all 649 Pokémon in some way or another. This is unaffected by the version chosen to play; encounters are the same in both.
Every single trainer in the game has had their Pokémon edited, fitting a new level curve and increasing the difficulty overall. While not mind crushingly tough, they're sure to provide more of a challenge than the original games were able to. The level curve takes full advantage of the new experience system in Black and White.

A vast number of Pokémon have had certain statistics about them edited. This can be a number of things, including experience rate, typing, base stats and abilities. A lot of Pokémon have been given their Dream World abilities as an option, where applicable and/or useful.
Pokémon have also had additions to their moveset, including additions or alterations to their level up movesets as well as TM and HM compatibility. Level up movesets in particular have been edited for 600+ Pokémon.

There has also been editing of many evolutions, generally involving those Pokémon who generally had to be traded to be evolved. Blaze Black and Volt White are entirely self-contained; no outside contact is required for anything.

Items found in the field have been changed considerably, to include TMs, evolution items and fossils previously only found post-League. The items have been adjusted in such a way that makes it convenient for the game's progress. Where applicable, text has also been changed to reflect these changes. Multiples of certain items, such as the evolution stones, the Lucky Egg and the EXP Share are also given out, all in the name of convenience.

It isn't just trainers and wild Pokémon who have had their levels changed; event Pokémon such as Reshiram and Zekrom have also had their levels changed, ensuring that they don't become useless due to the sharp increase in levels.

All five in-game trades have also been edited, giving you new possibilities for your team.
A small number of attacks have also been changed to make them more useful, generally in terms of power (and rarely, type).

A number of documents are included with the download that allow you to see any and all changes made. Wondering what's new? Where to find something? Consult the guides!

## Why play Blaze Black and/or Volt White?

With the extra amounts of Black and White hacks cropping up now, Blaze Black and Volt White has lost its main edge in being the only hack of its kind. I'd like to say that it being the first means something, but unfortunately it really doesn't in the long run. The main reason for playing Blaze Black and Volt White would be its dedication to the original games; with one or two exceptions the main Pokémon of a Gym Leader or Elite Four member does NOT change, and themes (including type and general appearance) are kept as best as possible. Things must make some degree of sense, or they won't be found in this hack. Most of the time.

These two also offer some "what ifs?" What if Flareon got Flare Blitz? What if Delibird actually had some stats? What if Weavile was given Technician? What if Gallade had kept Trace? What if the Gothitelle line actually had a Dark-typing? Just how broken would a Dragon-type Serperior with Contrary be? How about a Samurott with Shell Smash? (Between you and me, they are broken as hell!)

The game also tries to have as many Pokémon available early as possible, while still keeping them in appropriate places. There's a couple odd balls that are late such as Torkoal or Stunfisk as they were tough to place, but the majority are available before the sixth badge is up, and the majority of them are available at Nimbasa City or prior.

Blaze Black and Volt White also offer a 'clean' version, which is a relatively blank slate, keeping the 649 hack but eliminating all of the Pokémon changes. This is useful for the purist, and it's something no other hack has, as far as I'm aware.

If you're looking for a challenge designed by someone who thinks they know the Pokémon games in and out (and considering my ridiculous amount of knowledge about them and my three walkthroughs, I certainly hope I do!) then this is the hack to try. If you're looking for an incredibly difficult challenge... I'd recommend a different one. Although this one has its fair share of annoyances, too.

## Credits and Gratitude

elementking: It was thanks to him that I even got to start hacking B/W fully in the first place. Without him I probably wouldn't have discovered anything post Wild Pokemon editing.

Project Pokémon Forums: The ROM editing help section is a great way to find out if certain ideas are possible, and if so, how. Numerous people on there (as well as being found in other places) have made or stated discoveries that this hack uses, including Andibad, kaphotics and KazoWAR. Kazo in particular can also be thanked for the 1.1a incarnation of the trainer editor, a key tool for making this hack.

twistedfatal: His tools help to simplify things significantly, cutting down on the amount of hex editing required.

neltazero: His tools are also very helpful and quite easy to use, making Wild Pokemon and trainer editing that much easier.

SegNin: It's thanks to him we have the current .bat patching system for this, and by extension for Pitch Black and Pure White.

knivez69: The banner up top is his incredible work.

Various Members of GBAtemp and GameFAQs: For ideas on additions/changes to make.

## Bugs

- The exp is weirdly low from certain high levelled opponents. This is to do with the game, though, and is not fixable.

- It appears to be possible for an error to occur at Driftveil from repeated fishing then leaving... not sure about this one, but be sure to save around there just in case.
