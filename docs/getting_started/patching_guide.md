Patching is incredibly easy. Simply place a ROM of Black or White into the folder containing this Readme and the xdelta patches, and run the appropriate batch file for your choice of game.

Note that the ROM must be CLEAN. That is, no anti-piracy patch (the BB/VW patch covers the exp problem) and no other changes, either. Doing so may screw with the checksum, which will prevent the patch working.

European ROMs are recommended, though it isn't 100% guaranteed to fail or anything if you use the American one. You should probably only have one ROM in the folder at a time when you're trying to patch.

If you're really stuck for ROMs and are getting XD3 errors with whatever you're trying, take a look at Emuparadise and get the E/U one from there.

And remember...
