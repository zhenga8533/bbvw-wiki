Recall that no shaking grass will appear until after the first badge has been obtained!

'Special' refers to the rare spots. Doubles refers to tall grass where double battles can occur.

Unless otherwise stated, fishing encounters have not been edited.

Thanks go to Serebii.net for the images.

You won’t be able to get all 649 in the wild alone, but evolution will make it possible! You get enough evolution stones during the course of the game for everybody, so don’t fret.

Note that there are several sections with a “Legendary Encounter.” The legendary is a normal Wild Pokémon, just very rare. Obviously the total encounter chance can’t be 101-102%, but the Pokemon whose chance is lessened as a result is not listed. Usually, it’s just the last one in the list, so a 10% might become an 8%, a 5% might become a 4% etcetera. Although it’s somewhat untidy, this is the best method that can be done for now, due to scripting being impossible as of August 2011.

There are a couple of differences between Blaze Black and Volt White. Namely, Blaze Black will find Zekrom, Thundurus and the pink Shellos/Gastrodon wild, as well as Red Basculin only. Volt White instead get Reshiram, Tornadus and the blue Shellos/Gastrodon wild, and Blue Basculin only. The opposites of each legendary are catchable as per usual in their regular places.

## Liberty Garden

Legendary Encounter

```
Victini, Level 20
Liberty Tower Basement
```

There are no Wild Pokemon in here as usual, but this is the only place to catch Victini. It is currently impossible to give the ticket in-game and have it work fully.

You will need your .sav file. If you are using a flashcard such as an R4 or an Acekard, then it is likely to be readily available; you will just need to utilize your .sav file. Those of you using DeSmuME will have to use the Export Backup Memory found in the File drop-down, which will export your .dsv as a .sav. Finally, no$gba users will have to use the savegames converter to change the .sav in their BATTERY folder into a regular .sav.

You then need to load up your .sav with the Pokémon Mystery Gift Editor, made by Grovyle91. The setup was included in the download for the patch. If somehow you have this document but NOT the enclosed setup, you can download it here. Once installed, you will also need the .pgf file for the Liberty Ticket event. This also came with the download, but if you are missing it then you can get it from here.

The rest is simple; load up your .sav with the Pokémon Mystery Gift Editor (you don’t even need to take it off the storage device if you’re using a flashcard!) Once the new bit opens, click on Import PGF (change the Current Gift if you happen to already have wonder cards on there) and choose the Liberty Ticket pgf. Once loaded, simply hit the Save button at the top. This will save the Wonder Card to your save file.

Flashcards already have their .sav ready to play, but for the others; DeSmuME users should use the Import Backup Memory under the file tab to bring in the newly edited .sav. Be sure to reset the ROM afterwards for the best results. No$gba users can simply slot their .sav in the BATTERY folder and it should convert back to the no$ format automatically when the ROM is booted.

With the wonder card loaded, simply go into any Pokémon Center and talk to the blue guy on the right. You will get the Liberty Ticket and all required flags will be activated, allowing you to sail on the ship at the far left port of the city to the island. It’s all normal from there. Note that the trainer levels are sufficent for you to catch Victini the moment you first reach Castelia City.

Don’t let the length of the words fool you; it’s simple!

Legendary Encounter

```
Mewtwo, Level 75
Challenger's Cave, B1F
Cave, 1%
```

<sub><sup>_Mewtwo returns in a post League cave once more. Challenger's Cave is a lot like Cerulean’s Cave, but a certain Pokémon God stopped him getting into the real bottom floor. Still, the dark and damp is enough to make it feel like home._</sup></sub>

Legendary Encounter

```
Darkrai, Level 70
Challenger's Cave, B1F
Cave, 1%
```

<sub><sup>_The dark, mid-depths of the Challenger's Cave are also of intrigue to Darkrai, who loves the darkness and occasionally likes to taunt the people of Icirrus City and Opelucid City with nightmares. But you don’t need to hear about that._</sup></sub>
